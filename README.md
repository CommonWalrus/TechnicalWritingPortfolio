# TechnicalWritingPortfolio
This is the technical writing portfolio of Alex Berk

It is actively in development and will consist of projects I am undertaking to help develop my skills as well as showcasing documents I have created for work.

Phones out of range email

- This is an email I wrote to help end users reconnect their phones to the base station. The phones are unable to pair to a base station while on a call, so a clear, easy to follow written instruction set was needed. I wrote this after testing the process myself with the same type of device that was deployed to the customers, it has been in use for several years now.

Call forward and removal instructions

- This is an internal document I created to provide my coworkers a step by step guide in adding and removing call forwards for various clients. It's used as a quick reference for new teammates.

How To Play Magic

- This is a longer form document I wrote to explain something complicated I am an expert in. I attempted to create something in the mold of a starter booklet, that helps you to learn the game alongside a preconstucted deck. It is intended for new and inexperianced players, helping to build a foundation of how the game is played. Its currently being iterated based on feedback from people who do not play to ensure concepts are clear.
