# TechnicalWritingPortfolio
This is the technical writing portfolio of Alex Berk. This portfolio is actively in development and will consist of projects I am undertaking to help develop my skills as well as showcasing documents I have created.

Phones out of range email

- This is an email I wrote to help end users reconnect their phones to the base station. The phones are unable to pair to a base station while on a call, so a clear, easy to follow written instruction set was needed. I wrote this after testing the process myself with the same type of device that was deployed to the customers; it has been in use for several years now.

Call forward and removal instructions

- This is an internal document I created to provide my coworkers with a step by step guide for adding and removing call forwards for various clients. It's used as a quick reference and a teaching tool for new teammates.

How To Play Magic

- This is a longer form document I wrote to explain something complicated that I am an expert in. I attempted to create something in the mold of a starter booklet that helps you to learn the game alongside a preconstructed deck. It is intended for new and inexperienced players, helping to build a foundation of how the game is played. It's currently being iterated based on feedback from people who do not play to ensure concepts are clear.
