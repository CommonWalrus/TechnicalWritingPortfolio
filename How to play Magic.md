# Magic: the Gathering

## What is Magic?
Magic is a collectable card game in which two or more players try to defeat each other by summoning fearsome creatures and casting powerful spells. Magic is a very flexible game system, allowing for endless possiblities of play. With over 27,000 cards, a wealth of customization and self expression is available to you!

## Colors of Magic
Magic divides its cards into five colors of **mana**, white, blue, black, red, and green. Each color represents a different ethos and way to play the game.

### White
White magic is all about community, selflessness, and order. Some of white's creatures are soldiers, knights, clerics, and angels. Its spells bolster its creatures, remove impediemnts, or equalize the playing field. White can struggle with drawing cards and the small size of its creatures.

### Blue
Blue magic focuses on logic, technology, and preparation. Blue summons wizards, sphinxs, merfolk, and deepsea creatures to help in battle. Its spells are proactive and flexable, focused around stopping or stalling problems before they get out of control. Blue can struggle with stopping problems that are already underway.

### Black
Black magic is ruthless, efficient, and feels the ends always justify the means. Black consorts with warlocks, vampires, zombies, and demons. Its spells are cutthroat, sometimes even harming yourself for powerful effects. Black can struggle against threats it cannot destroy outright.

### Red
Red magic is passionate, impulsive, and fiery. Red fights alongside goblins, shamans, warriors and dragons. Its spells excel at dealing damage and breaking things. Red can stuggle with opponents who can stall their assaults.

### Green
Green magic embodies nature, growth, and change. Green allies itself with elves, druids, treefolk, and hydras. Its spells allow it to play imposing threats early and destroy that which is unnatural. Green can struggle when it's titanic creatures are contained.

## How to play Magic

### Basics
In a game of Magic, your goal is to defeat your opponent, usually by reducing their life total to 0. However, defeating your opponent is no easy task, and there are many ways to go about it! Each player should bring a deck that consists of at least 60 cards, ideally in a combination of lands, creatures and other spells. You use your lands to cast your spells by **tapping** <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/mtgsalvation_gamepedia/images/b/be/T.svg/revision/latest?cb=20160125095850" alt="Tap Symbol" style="width:25px;"/> them to produce mana. Whether or not something is **tapped** in a game of Magic is important, as tapped lands are unable to produce more resources, tapped creatures cannot block, and some abilites require tapping the card to use them.

### Parts of a card
Cards in Magic contain a lot of information! Look at the card below:

The top line of a card contains its name, in this case Lightning Strike, and its **mana cost**, the symbols to the right of the name. You can pay this by can pay this cost by tapping land to produce mana. This card costs 2 mana total, and at least 1 must be red mana. Below the art is the type line, where the cards types and any subtypes are specified. Lightning Strike is an instant. On the far right of the type line is the set symbol, which you can use to tell what set a card was printed in, this has no effect on the game. The large box just below the type line is the cards rules text. Lightning Bolt's rules text is strightforward, it will deal 3 damage to any target. Lets take a look at another card:

Serra Angel costs five mana total, and at least 2 must be white. It is a creature and has the subtype of angel. Serra Angel has two abilities, flying and vigilence. Finally, in the bottom right of the card are its combat statistics. The first number is its power, 4, and the second is its toughness, also 4. We'll talk about this more in the **creatures** section below.

### Types of cards

There are 7 types of cards you can expect to see in a typical game of Magic:
- Lands
- Creatures
- Artifacts
- Enchantments
- Planeswalkers
- Sorceries
- Instants


#### Lands
Lands are the backbone for any deck of Magic. As discussed above, cards cost mana to cast. Lands can be used to create mana to pay for spells. Tapping a land usually creates 1 mana, but the type of mana can be different depending on the land. There are 5 basic land types:
- Plains, which tap for white mana
- Islands, which tap for blue mana
- Swamps, which tap for black mana
- Mountains, which tap for red mana
- Forests, which tap for green mana

![The five basic lands](https://52f4e29a8321344e30ae-0f55c9129972ac85d6b1f4e703468e6b.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/products/pictures/109040.jpg)

In addition to basic lands, a variety of nonbasic lands are available for use as well. These can sometimes produce more than one color of mana, or have additional abilities. For example, some lands can even become creatures temporarily! 

#### Creatures

<img src="https://cards.scryfall.io/large/front/d/3/d389b8db-5866-4146-a379-f24b6463622b.jpg?1562304398" alt="Shivan Dragon" style="width:325px;"/>

Creatures do a lot of work in defeating your opponent. They're your forces with which you can do battle, attacking your enemies or defending you from incoming threats. Whenever you summon a creature, it has **summoning sickness** until your next turn. Creatures cannot attack or tap to activate abilities during this time. However, they can still block, allowing them to protect you from opposing creatures.

##### Power and Toughness
As noted earlier, creatures have two numbers in the bottom right of their text box, with a / seperating them. The first number is their power, representing how much damage they can do, and the second is their toughness, showing how much damage they can take. Whenever a creature has taken more damage in a turn than their toughness, they die. Other cards can change a creatures power or toughness, and will note that change as +A/+B or -A/-B. If a creature ever has less than 0 toughness due to one of these modifications, it dies. 


#### Artifacts


<img src="https://cards.scryfall.io/large/front/7/9/7980fc3b-71d5-427d-bd42-087256fd2059.jpg?1562877858" alt="Staff of Domination" style="width:325px;"/>


Artifacts can be enigmatic relics, fanciful inventions, powerful weapons, or anything in between. Artifacts can do many things, but usually they will either have an ability that applies constantly or an ability that you can activate. Sometimes they have both! Artifacts can also be creatures, like automatons or vehicles. 



#### Enchantments

<img src="https://cards.scryfall.io/large/front/5/4/54af08f7-9c6c-464e-b2f7-2b5803f36481.jpg?1584831336" alt="Wilderness Reclaimation" style="width:325px;"/>

Enchantments are magic that seeps into something, be that a creature or the world at large. Some enchantments can have sweeping effects, like making your opponents unable to attack you. Others, like auras, a common enchantment subtype, can enhance and augment creatures to new heights of strength. 



#### Planeswalkers

<img src="https://cards.scryfall.io/large/front/a/c/ac506c17-adc8-49c6-9d8d-43db7cb1ec9d.jpg?1562835390" alt="Liliana of the Veil" style="width:325px;"/>

Planeswalkers are allies you can summon to assist you in battle. Once per turn, they can activate one of their abilities, which can be anything from mundane to game winning. They can be attacked by your opponents as though they were a player; defending them will give you more time to activate their more powerful abilities!

##### Loyalty and loyalty abilities
Planeswalkers enter with a number of **loyalty counters** on them equal to the number in the bottom right of their card. Once per turn, you can activate one of their abilities by adding or subtracting loyalty counters from them equal to the left of their abilities. When a planeswalker is dealt damage, they lose loyalty counters equal to the damage dealt to them. If their loyalty reaches 0, they are destroyed.

#### Sorceries

<img src="https://cards.scryfall.io/large/front/1/e/1ed43ed8-9490-4433-843f-9020cd3470a1.jpg?1562635091" alt="Day of Judgement" style="width:325px;"/>

Sorceries are spells you can cast during your turn. They can do nearly anything in the game, with effects as varied as drawing cards, dealing damage, or reanimating the dead.



#### Instants


<img src="https://cards.scryfall.io/large/front/1/9/1920dae4-fb92-4f19-ae4b-eb3276b8dac7.jpg?1628801663" alt="Counterspell" style="width:325px;"/>

Instants are very similar to sorceries. However, while other spells can only be played one at a time during your main phase, instants can be played at anytime. Instants can even counter another spell, stopping it from ever happening!




### Parts of a turn
A turn of Magic is broken into many parts, called phases and steps. Each of these segments serves a different purpose to allow the game to flow smoothly.

#### Beginning phase
The beginning phase consists of three steps, untap, upkeep, and draw. 


<!--- 
Bullet point steps under phases?
--->
##### Untap step
During your untap step, you untap all of your **permanents**. If a permanent has a stun **counter** on it, instead remove a stun counter and leave it tapped. Players cannot cast spells or activate abilities during the untap step.

##### Upkeep step
Your upkeep step is the first time you can take actions in a turn. Either player may cast instants or activate **abilties** before the step ends. The player who's turn it is has the first opportunity to take any of these actions.

##### Draw step
This step starts with the active player drawing a card. Then there is a similar window for players to cast spells and activate abilities like in the upkeep step. If you are going first, you skip your first draw step in your first turn.

#### Main phase
The main phase is where the bulk of spells are cast. You can cast any type of spell during your main phase, as well as play your land for the turn. There is an additonal main phase following the combat phase, where you can play more spells after combat.

#### Combat phase
The combat phase has five steps, beginning of combat, declare attackers, declare blockers, combat damage, and end of combat.

##### Beginning of combat step
The beginning of combat step is the first time you can take actions during this phase. "At the beginning of combat on your turn" abilities happen here. Like the upkeep step, you can respond to those abilities and either player may cast instants or activate other abilties before the step ends.

##### Declare attackers step
This step starts with you declaring which creatures are attacking, as well as who or what those creatures are attacking. Each creature can only attack a single opponent or planeswalker an opponent controls. Creatures tap to attack unless they have **vigilence.**  Once attackers are declared, there is another oppertunity for players to cast instants or activate abilities. 

##### Declare blockers step
The defending player then declares blockers, assigning their creatures to block incoming attackers. You can assign multiple blockers to a single attacker, however the attacker gets to decide the order in which damage is dealt to them. Once blockers are assigned, there is another window for players to react. 

##### Combat damage step
Now that you've determinded how everything is attacking and blocking, damage is dealt. Creatures with **first strike** and **double strike** deal their damage first, then damage is dealt by other creatures (and again by creatures with double strike). After each time damage is dealt, there is another oppertunity for players to react.

##### End of combat step
This is a final oppertunity for things to happen that requrie a creature to be in combat. There is another chance for reactions from players before this step ends.

#### Ending phase
Once you are finished with your second main phase, you can pass the turn to the next player. The ending phase has two steps, end and cleanup.

##### End step
The end step is the last oppertunity for players to cast instants or activate abilities here before the turn passes to the next player.

##### Cleanup step
Players cannot abilities activated or cast spells during the cleanup step, much like the upkeep step. During the cleanup step, damage on creatures wears off, and the player whose turn is ending discards cards to their maximum handsize if they are over that limit.

### Deck construction and game formats
Magic functions as a rules system with which you can play a variety of games, much like how a ball can be used for both soccer and basketball. These are called formats, and each one helps to define how the games is played more specifically. Unless otherwise noted, players should start the game with 20 life. In any format with more then 2 players, the starting player will get to draw on their first turn.

#### Constructed
In constucted formats, you bring your own deck of at least 60 cards. You are limited to 4 copies of any card, but may use an unlimited number of basic lands. The cards you may use in constructed formats are often defined by when they were printed. Standard encompasses cards printed in the last 2-3 years, wheras Pioneer allows cards printed since 2012. Older formats include Modern (2003 onward), and Legacy (All cards since the games inception in 1994).

#### Limited
In limited formats, you open packs of cards to build you deck on the fly. In all limited formats, your deck must contain at least 40 cards, and you may add an unlimited number of basic lands. This is no limit to the number of copies of a card you can play.

##### Draft
In a draft event, you start at a table with several other players (usually 8 players total). Each player is given 3 packs of cards. The draft will start with each player opening their first pack of cards, selecting one card from it, and passing the remaining cards to the player to their left. When they receive a pack of cards from the player to their right, repeating this process until there are no more cards to select. Once the first pack is completed, players will open the second pack, and pass the cards to the right, picking one at a time as before. The third pack goes back to the left. Once all players have completed their selections, they will build their decks using them.

##### Sealed
In a sealed event, you start with 6 packs of cards. Open all 6 and build the best deck you can from the contents. 

#### Commander
Commander is a casual, multiplayer format. A deck consists of a legendary creature, the eponymous commander, and 99 other cards. You may only have a single copy of any card in your deck outside of basic lands. All cards in the deck must match the commander's **color identity**, which is defined as all colors of mana in the commander's casting cost as well as any activated abilities it has. For example, a deck that has designated Aesi as its commander may only consist of green and blue cards, while a deck led by Kenrith, the Returned King can contain cards of all five colors.

![Aesi, Tyrant of Gyer Strait](https://cards.scryfall.io/large/front/d/6/d607b003-6b48-429c-a7fd-45b8dd1bb4f9.jpg?1665822343)

In addition to the unique deck construction rules, commander makes some changes to how the game is played. Your will commander start the game in the *command zone*, and can be cast while in the command zone. Each time your commander would be sent to the graveyard or be exiled, you may choose to have them return to the command zone. If you do, they will cast 2 more mana to cast for each time they have been returned there. In commander, players will also lose the game if they have been dealt 21 damage by a single commander.
