# Magic: the Gathering

## What is Magic?
Magic is a collectable card game in which two or more players try to defeat each other by summoning fearsome creatures and casting powerful spells. Magic is a very flexible game system, allowing for endless possiblities of play. With over 27,000 cards, a wealth of customization and self expression is available to you!

## Colors of Magic
Magic divides its cards into five colors of mana, white, blue, black, red, and green. Each color represents a different ethos and way to play the game.

### White
White magic is all about community, selflessness, and order. Some of white's creatures are soldiers, knights, clerics, and angels. Its spells bolster its creatures, remove impediemnts, or equalize the playing field. White can struggle with drawing cards and the small size of its creatures.

### Blue
Blue magic focuses on logic, technology, and preparation. Blue summons wizards, sphinxs, merfolk, and deepsea creatures to help in battle. Its spells are proactive and flexable, focused around stopping or stalling problems before they get out of control. Blue can struggle with stopping problems that are already underway.

### Black
Black magic is ruthless, efficient, and feels the ends always justify the means. Black consorts with warlocks, vampires, zombies, and demons. Its spells are cutthroat, sometimes even harming yourself for powerful effects. Black can struggle against threats it cannot destroy outright.

### Red
Red magic is passionate, impulsive, and fiery. Red fights alongside goblins, shamans, warriors and dragons. Its spells excel at dealing damage and breaking things. Red can stuggle with opponents who can stall their assaults.

### Green
Green magic embodies nature, growth, and change. Green allies itselves with elves, druids, treefolk, and hydras. Its spells allow it to play imposing threats early and destroy that which is unnatural. Green can struggle when it's unable to keep its large creatures around.

## How to play Magic

### Parts of a card
Cards in Magic contain a lot of information! Look at the card below:

![Lightning Strike](https://cards.scryfall.io/large/front/0/8/084b7337-c06f-4cbf-8fc0-0b20c221f1dc.jpg?1562300290)

The top line of a card contains its name, in this case Lightning Strike, and its mana cost, the symbols to the right of the name. This card costs 2 mana total, and at least 1 must be red mana. Below the art is the type line, where the cards types and any subtypes are specified. Lightning Strike is an instant. The large box just below the type line is the cards rules text. Lightning Bolt's rules text is strightforward, it will deal 3 damage to any target. Lets take a look at another card:


![Serra Angel](https://cards.scryfall.io/large/front/3/5/350c41af-18e5-4ce8-b3b1-64baa85b1acb.jpg?1562197862)

Serra Angel cost five mana total, and at least 2 must be white. It is a creature and has the subtype of angel. Serra Angel has two abilities, flying and vigilence. Finally, in the bottom right of the card are its combat statistics. The first number is its power, 4, and the second is its toughness, also 4. This means that whenever Serra Angel is in combat it will deal 4 damage, and it can take 4 damage over the course of a turn before it is destroyed.

### Types of cards

There are 7 types of cards you can expect to see in a typical game of Magic:
- Lands
- Creatures
- Artifacts
- Enchantments
- Planeswalkers
- Sorceries
- Instants


#### Lands
Lands are the backbone for any deck of Magic. As discussed above, cards cost mana to cast. Lands can be used to create mana to pay for spells. "Tapping" a land usually creates 1 mana, but the type of mana can be different depending on the land. There are 5 basic land types:
- Plains, which tap for white mana
- Islands, which tap for blue mana
- Swamps, which tap for black mana
- Mountains, which tap for red mana
- Forests, which tap for green mana

In addition to basic lands, a variety of nonbasic lands are available for use as well. These can sometimes produce more than one color of mana, or have additional abilities. For example, some lands can even become creatures temporarily! 

#### Creatures
Creatures do a lot of work in defeating your opponent. They're your forces with which you can do battle, attacking your enemies or defending you from incoming threats. Whenever you summon a creature, it has "Summoning Sickness" until your next turn. Creatures cannot attack or activate abilities during this time. However, they can still block, allowing them to protect you from opposing creatures.

#### Artifacts
Artifacts can be enigmatic relics, fanciful inventions, powerful weapons, or anything in between. Artifacts can do many things, but usually they will either have an ability that applies constantly or an ability that you can activate. Sometimes they have both! Artifacts can also be creatures, like a golem given life. 

#### Enchantments
Enchantments are magic that seeps into something, be that a creature or the world at large. Some enchantments can have sweeping effects, like making your opponents unable to takke you. Others, like auras, a common enchantment subtype, can enhance and augment creatures to new heights of strength. 

#### Planeswalkers
Planeswalkers are allies you can summon to assist you in battle. Once per turn, they can activate one of their abilities, which can be anything from mundane to game winning. They can be attacked by your opponents as though they were a player; defending them will give you more time to activate their more powerful abilities!

#### Sorceries
Sorceries are spells you can cast during your turn. They can do nearly anything in the game, with effects as varied as drawing cards, dealing damage, or reanimating the dead.

#### Instants
Instants are very similar to sorceries, but they can be played at anytime. Instants can even counter another spell, stopping it from ever happening!
