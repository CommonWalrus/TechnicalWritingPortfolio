# Magic: the Gathering

## What is Magic?
Magic is a collectable card game in which two or more players try to defeat each other by summoning fearsome creatures and casting powerful spells. Magic is a very flexible game system, allowing for endless possiblities of play. With over 27,000 cards, a wealth of customization and self expression is available to you!

## Colors of Magic
Magic divides its cards into five colors of mana, white, blue, black, red, and green. Each color represents a different ethos and way to play the game.

### White
White magic is all about community, selflessness, and order. Some of white's creatures are soldiers, knights, clerics, and angels. Its spells bolster its creatures, remove unfair impediemnts, or equalize the playing field. White can struggle with drawing cards and the small size of its creatures.

### Blue
Blue magic focuses on logic, technology, and preparation. Blue summons wizards, sphinxs, merfolk, and deepsea creatures to help in battle. Its spells are proactive and flexable, focused around stopping or stalling problems before they get out of control. Blue can struggle with stopping problems that are already underway.

### Black
Black magic is ruthless, efficient, and feels the ends always justify the means. Black consorts with warlocks, vampires, zombies, and demons. Its spells are cutthroat, sometimes even harming yourself for powerful effects. Black struggles against threats it cannot destroy outright.

### Red
Red magic is passionate, impulsive, and fiery. Red fights alongside goblins, shamans, warriors and dragons. Its spell excel at dealing damage and breaking things. Red stuggles with games that go long.

### Green
Green magic embodies nature, growth, and change. Green allies itselves with elves, druids, treefolk, and hydras. Its spells allow it to play imposing threats early and destroy that which is unnatural. Green struggles when it is unable to keep its large creatures around.

## How to play Magic

### Parts of a card
Cards in Magic contain a lot of information! Look at the card below:

![Lightning Bolt](https://cards.scryfall.io/large/front/f/2/f29ba16f-c8fb-42fe-aabf-87089cb214a7.jpg?1673147852)

The top line of a card contains its name, in this case Lightning Bolt, and its mana cost, the red symbol to the right. Below the art is the type line, where the cards types and any subtypes are specified. Lightning Bolt is an instant. The large box just below the type line is the cards rules text. Lightning Bolt's rules text is strightforward, it will deal 3 damage to any target. Lets take a look at another card:


![Serra Angel](https://cards.scryfall.io/large/front/3/5/350c41af-18e5-4ce8-b3b1-64baa85b1acb.jpg?1562197862)

Serra Angel is a creature and has the subtype of angel. Serra Angel has two abilities, flying and vigilence. Finally, in the bottom right of the card are its combat statistics. The first number is its power, 4, and the second is its toughness, also 4. This means that whenever Serra Angel is in combat it will deal 4 damage, and it can take 4 damage over the course of a turn before it is destroyed.
