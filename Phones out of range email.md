Here are the directions to reconnect the phone to the base. 

1.	First locate the transmitter box (base); it’s usually inconveniently high up on a wall. It’s about 5 in. tall, 4 in. deep, and 1 in. wide. A picture of the transmitter is included below. (This has been omitted from my public GitHub)
2.	Press and hold the silver button on the front of the transmitter box for 4 seconds. Once you release the button, both lights above it should begin blinking.
3.	On the affected phone, enter the menu by pressing the center button (marked as Menu/Select).
4.	Select “User Settings”, the second to last option.
5.	Select “Registration”, the last option.
6.	Select “This Handset”.
7.	The phone should then prompt you with “Press and Hold the Handset Locator key at base for 4 seconds” and “Then, press the # key at the Handset”.
8.	Press the # key. The phone will display “registering please wait” for several seconds before making a small beeping noise.
9.	The handset should now be reconnected to the phone system.

This process might fail if the lights stop blinking on the transmitter before pressing # on the phone. If that’s the case, just try again. The lights usually blink for about 30-40 seconds after pressing the silver button.




<!--- This is an email I wrote to help end users reconnect their phones to the base station. The phones are unable to pair to a base station while on a call, so a clear, easy to follow instruction set was needed. I wrote this after testing the process myself with the same type of device that was deployed to the customers, it has been in use for several years now. --->
