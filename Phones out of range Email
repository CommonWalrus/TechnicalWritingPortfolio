Here are the directions to reconnect the phone to the base. 

1)	We first need to locate the transmitter box (base), its usually inconveniently high up on a wall. Its about 5 inches tall, 4 inches deep, and 1 inch wide. I have included a picture of what it looks like below.
2)	Press and hold the silver button on the front of the transmitter box for 4 seconds, once you release the button, both lights should begin blinking
3)	Go to the affected phone and enter the menu by pressing the center button (Marked as Menu/Select)
4)	Press down until you get to “User Settings”, it should be the second option from the bottom. Press the Menu/Select button to enter the User Settings menu
5)	Press down until you get to “Registration”, it should be the bottom option. Press the Menu/Select button to enter registration
6)	Then Select “This Handset” by pressing the Menu/Select button
7)	The Phone should then prompt you with “Press and Hold the Handset Locator key at base for 4 seconds” and “Then, press the #key at the Handset”
8)	Press the # key and the phones should then say “registering please wait” for several second before making a small beeping noise.
9)	After that, the handset should be reconnected to the phone system
10)	This process might fail if the lights stop blinking on the transmitter box (base) before pressing # on the phone. If that’s the case, just try again. The lights usually blink for about 30-40 seconds after pressing the silver button.
